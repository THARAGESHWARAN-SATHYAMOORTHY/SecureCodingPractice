## *Windows Kernel â€“ Summary*

---

### *Understanding Windows Kernel: Architecture*
- *Layered Architecture:* Each layer provides services to the layer above, creating a dependency chain and a trust-based model.
- *Separation:* Critical system resources are protected by isolating user mode and kernel mode.
  
---

### *Architecture Overview*
- *User Mode:* Runs environment subsystems (Win32, OS/2, POSIX) and applications with limited access via system calls.
- *Kernel Mode:* Full hardware access; includes Executive kernel, HAL, Kernel-Mode drivers managing memory, processes, hardware.

---

### *Executive*
- *Core Services:* Provided by NTOSKRNL.EXE.
- *Key Subsystems:*
  - *Object Manager:* Manages system resources (files, devices, processes).
  - *I/O Manager:* Manages user I/O requests through IRPs and cache optimization.
  - *Memory Manager:* Handles virtual memory, paging, protection, session space.
  - *Process Manager:* Manages process/thread creation, job objects.
  - *Security Reference Monitor (SRM):* Enforces security via ACLs and SIDs.
  - *Configuration Manager:* Handles Windows registry.
  - *Plug & Play Manager:* Device detection, installation, resource allocation.
  - *Local Procedure Call (LPC):* IPC between user-mode and kernel-mode.

---

### *Kernel*
- *Responsibilities:*
  - Multiprocessor synchronization
  - Thread scheduling
  - Interrupt and trap handling
- *Hybrid Kernel Design:* Combines modularity (microkernel) + performance (monolithic).

---

### *Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)*
- *Functions:*
  - Hardware abstraction
  - Interrupt management
  - Processor initialization
  - Power management
- *HAL.DLL:* Dynamic library loaded at startup, tightly coupled with the kernel, platform-specific.

---

### *Privilege Rings*
- *Windows NT uses 2 privilege levels:*
  - *Ring 0:* (Kernel Mode) Full access (Executive, Kernel, HAL, drivers).
  - *Ring 3:* (User Mode) Limited access.
- *Benefits:* System stability, RISC architecture compatibility.

---

### *Interrupt Request Level (IRQL)*
- (Only mentioned, details skipped in the doc.)

---

### *Memory Management*
- *Handled by Memory Manager.*
- Responsibilities:
  - Virtual and physical memory management
  - Memory protection
  - Shared memory
  - Memory-mapped files

---

### *Virtual Address Space*
- *Process Memory Layout:*
  - *User Space:* 0x00000000â€“0x7FFFFFFF (2 GB on 32-bit).
  - *Kernel Space:* 0x80000000â€“0xFFFFFFFF (2 GB on 32-bit).
- *Features:* ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), large address space support.

---

### *Memory Pool*
- *Kernel memory region* divided into:
  - *Non-Paged Pool:* Always in physical memory (ISRs, driver data).
  - *Paged Pool:* Swappable to disk (registry data, filesystem metadata).
- *Memory Manager:* Handles optimized allocation and fragmentation avoidance.
- *Monitoring Tools:* PoolMon.

---

### *Driver Internals*
- *Purpose:* Interaction between OS and hardware.

- *Driver Types:*
  - *Highest-Level:* File system drivers (NTFS, FAT).
  - *Intermediate:* WDM drivers, network drivers.
  - *Low-Level:* PnP bus drivers, legacy drivers.

- *Architecture:*
  - *IRPs:* Communication mechanism for I/O.
  - *Driver Stack:* Layered arrangement of drivers.
  - *Entry Points:* DriverEntry, Dispatch Routines, Unload Routine.

---

### *Kernel-Level Attack Interest*
- *Strategic Value:*
  - Unrestricted system access.
  - Sophisticated evasion (rootkits).
  - Subverting trusted security products.

- *Kernel Driver Exploitation:*
  - Malicious drivers have same trust as legitimate ones.
  - Exploiting PID checks, Kernel Handle verification, ExGetPreviousMode.

- *Detection Challenges:*
  - Difficult for third-party products to monitor kernel operations.

---

### *State of Windows Kernel Threats*

- *Pre-KMCS Era (Pre-Vista 64-bit):*
  - No enforcement of driver signing.
  - Exploits via direct kernel memory modification and loading unsigned drivers.

- *KMCS Era (Vista 64-bit and Beyond):*
  - Enforced Kernel Mode Code Signing (KMCS).
  - Cryptographic verification, PatchGuard, WHQL certification, Secure Boot, TPM, VBS, HVCI.

---

### *Kernel Vulnerabilities*

#### *Arbitrary Memory Overwrite*
- Attackers overwrite arbitrary memory to escalate privileges (e.g., altering Process Token or Function Pointers).

#### *Memory Disclosure*
- Attackers read sensitive memory due to:
  - Uninitialized memory
  - Information leaks
- *Leak Function Pointers:* Read to determine base addresses.

#### *Pool Overflow*
- Overflows corrupt memory in kernel pools.
- Steps:
  1. Identify corruption target (tokens, function pointers).
  2. Groom the pool layout.
  3. Achieve arbitrary read/write.
  4. Escalate privileges.

- *Corruption Targets:*
  - Process tokens
  - Function pointers
  - Object headers

---

### *Mitigations*

#### *Against Arbitrary Memory Overwrite*
- ASLR
- CFG (Control Flow Guard)
- Stack Canaries

#### *Against Memory Disclosure*
- Memory zeroing
- KASLR (Kernel ASLR)

#### *Against Pool Overflow*
- Pool integrity checks
- Pool quarantine
- DEP (Data Execution Prevention)

---

### *Exploit Mitigation Techniques*
- Targeting:
  - Stack/heap overflows
  - Integer overflows
  - Null pointer dereference
  - Use-after-free
  - Type confusion
  - Race conditions
  - Logic bugs

- *Windows Mitigations:*
  - KMCS
  - SMAP/SMEP
  - KASLR
  - CFG
  - VBS and Device/Credential Guard
  - PatchGuard

---

### *Specific Mitigations Explained*

- *Kernel Mode Code Signing:*
  - Signed drivers required.
  - EV certificates only (Server 2019 onward).
  - Leaked certs can be abused.

- *Supervisor Mode Execution/Access Prevention (SMAP/SMEP):*
  - SMEP: Blocks kernel from executing user-space code.
  - SMAP: Blocks kernel from accessing user-space memory.

- *Kernel ASLR:*
  - Improved entropy (4 bits â†’ 22 bits).
  - Randomized HAL heap, removed kernel pointer references.
  - Restricted information leaks.
